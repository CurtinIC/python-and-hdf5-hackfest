            The PyTables and h5py projects are holding an hackfest at Curtin
            University. The focus of the event is the overreaching plan
            decided by the two teams at SciPy 2015: refactoring the Python and
            HDF5 stack by rebasing PyTables on top of the low-level API
            provided by h5py.

              University, Perth, Australia</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>HDF5 is an open-source, high-performance data storage and manipulation platform, capable of handling data scales from kilobytes to exabytes. As such, it is a critical component in many scientific computing projects, ranging from Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics to Computational Biology to Nuclear Engineering.</p>
          <p>Python is open-source, general-purpose programming language with a deep and broad scientific computing ecosystem. Users who intend to read and write HDF5 stored data from Python are faced with a choice between two long-standing packages with overlapping capabilities: h5py and PyTables.
            Both packages allows to access and manipulate HDF5 datafile but they strongly differer in spirit: while h5py wants to stay as close as possible to the original HDF5 C API, PyTables adds sophisticated features as indexing and out-of-core querying. h5py and Pytables suit slightly different use cases, and interactions with other software packages often end up requiring both packages to be used.</p>
          <p>To solve this confusing situation, developers from PyTables, h5py, The HDF Group, as well as other community members have delineated a plan to simplify the stack for Python and HDF5. This plan contains the following components:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Refactor PyTables to depend on h5py for low-level operation</li>
            <li>Extend h5py to cover all the HDF5 API needed by PyTables</li>
            <li>Retain in PyTables its high-level abstractions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This plan will make h5py â€“ PyTables interactions seamless and will benefit users, developers and the general ecosystem.</p>

          <p>
              About the workshop: Python is one of the most popular languages
              for scientific computing today. Its applications span from
              testing out ideas on laptops through to high-performance
              computing simulations running on tens of thousands of nodes.
              This workshop will provide an introduction to the basics of
              modern, open source, scientific python. The first hour will
              cover NumPy and array-oriented programming. The second hour will
              discuss the Pandas package and DataFrames. Lastly, the third
              hour will discuss symbolic mathematics with SymPy. Throughout
              this session, we will demonstrate the use of the Jupyter
              Notebook for interactive computing and matplotlib for the
              creation of publication quality figures and plots.
          </p>
          <p>
              Requirements: Please note that this is not an introduction to
              programming. Attendees are expected to have a basic familiarity
              with Python and Software Carpentry graduates should be able to
              follow. Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or
              Windows operating sytem (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that
              they have administrative privileges on. Participants should have
              a working Python installation (we recommend installing Anaconda
              Python) and should be familiar with installing Python packages.

              Abstract: During the last decade the evolution of the computers
              has been much different than before. Instead of seeing
              acceleration in CPU clock speeds we are seeing more cores in
              CPUs, and instead of having plain simple architectures with a
              CPU, memory and hard disk, we are seeing computer facilities
              with several CPUs, several levels of caches and several
              persistent layers of storage. It is unfortunate that not many
              libraries are being designed nowadays with this shift in mind.
              My intention is to explain how to tackle with this efficiently
              during the making of libraries for handling big datasets. We
              will see that the election of a good language is important too,
              and how Python, complemented with others (like Cython, C or
              Julia), is a good match for this.
