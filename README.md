# Python & HDF5 hackfest

The PyTables and h5py projects are holding an hackfest at Curtin University.
The focus of the event is the overreaching plan decided by the two teams at
SciPy 2015: refactoring the Python and HDF5 stack by rebasing PyTables on top
of the low-level API provided by h5py.

**When:** 8â€“11 August 2106
**Where:** Cisco IoE Innovation Centre, Curtin University, Perth, Australia
